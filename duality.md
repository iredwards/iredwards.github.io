I looked up the article on duality in [The Princeton Companon to Mathematics](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691118802/the-princeton-companion-to-mathematics). I really love the companion, but this time I got confused by an error stating the dual of a cube is an *octagon*, instead of an *octahedron*. Was there some kind of projection happening that I wasn't seeing? ChatGPT was no help, repeating the same error. Eventually I saw the error for what it is, and got a stronger notion of duality for the effort. But typos and errors that an expert skims past can be an obstacle to the beginner.

Bartosz Milewski talks about reversing arrows [here in lecture 4.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsdl_NKbNnU&t=142s) and section 5.3 of his book.

[Richard Southwell's video on duality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIc0K81yz6E&list=PLCTMeyjMKRkoS699U0OJ3ymr3r01sI08l&index=4), starting with terminal objects and progressing to products/coproducts.

I do remember being disappointed long ago in a Linear Algebra class on learning what a *dual space* is. I think I was expecting something more like a parallel universe, like Narnia through the wardrobe. Maybe that's why I didn't remember duality. Do they even have octagons in Narnia?
