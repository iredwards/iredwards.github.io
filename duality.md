# Duality

I looked up the article on duality in [The Princeton Companon to Mathematics](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691118802/the-princeton-companion-to-mathematics). I really love the Companion, but this time I got confused by an error stating the dual of a cube is an *octagon*, instead of an *octahedron*. Was there some kind of projection happening that I wasn't seeing? ChatGPT was no help, repeating the same error. Eventually I saw the error for what it is, and got a stronger notion of duality for the effort. But typos and errors that an expert skims past can be an obstacle to the beginner. I like the Companion so much I bought a copy of all 1000+ pages. In my later printing they corrected the octagon error.

I do remember being disappointed long ago in a Linear Algebra class on learning what a *dual space* is. I think I was expecting something more like a parallel universe, like Narnia through the wardrobe. Maybe that's why I didn't remember duality. Do they even have octagons in Narnia?

## Joy of Abstraction

Section 17: Duality

1. Turning arrows around
2. Dual category
3. Monic and epic
4. Terminal and initial
5. An alternative definition of categories

## CT for Programmers

Bartosz Milewski talks about reversing arrows [here in lecture 4.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsdl_NKbNnU&t=142s) and [section 5.3 of his book](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2015/01/07/products-and-coproducts/).

## CT for Beginnners

Richard Southwell's video #4 [Duality and Functors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIc0K81yz6E&list=PLCTMeyjMKRkoS699U0OJ3ymr3r01sI08l&index=4), starting with terminal objects and progressing to products/coproducts.

## Intro to CT

Harold Simmons covers duality throughout section 2: Basic gadgetry

1. Diagram chasing
2. Monics and epics
3. simple limits and colimits
4. Initial and final objects
5. Products and coproducts
6. Equalizers and coequalizers
7. Pullbacks and pushouts
8. Using the opposite category
