I'm learning Category Theory on a lark. It got my attention after reading that it emphasizes looking at the relationships between objects over looking at objects themselves. That is the most valuable insight I absorbed from doing a Math degree long ago. 

I'm working my way through Eugenia Cheng's new book [The Joy of Abstraction](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/the-joy-of-abstraction/00D9AFD3046A406CB85D1AFF5450E657). I'm also enjoying re-reading it along with the [Joy of Abstraction book club](https://topos.site/joa-bookclub/) that started in February. These are some notes on my journey.

I've long been fascinated by *Tables of Contents* and *Indexes*. They are useful study aids. [Here](joa-index) are some additions I scribbled into the index of the Joyful book. My intention is to [post my notes](ct-tocs) mapping relationships between some other useful resources. I want that epic ToC! See also, [Everything is Miscellaneous](https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Miscellaneous-Power-Digital-Disorder-ebook/dp/B000R7PUW4) and its dual [Index, A History of the](https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Miscellaneous-Power-Digital-Disorder-ebook/dp/B000R7PUW4).

## Resources

[Category Theory for Programmers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8LbkfSSR58&list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_) by Bartosz Milewski. This excellent lecture series and [book](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf) approach CT from the perspective of functional programming. You don't need to be a programmer to follow, but if you're not carefull you might pick up a bit of Haskell along the way. 

[Categories for the Working Mathematician](https://www.amazon.com/Categories-Working-Mathematician-Graduate-Mathematics/dp/0387984038) by Saunders Mac Lane. Just kidding! I'm not in the target audience of this [OG textbook](https://aperiodical.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FTBdMZ5XsAAeq8C.png) by one of the discovers of CT. But every other book refers to it and it pervades spacetime like the ether. Part of his ToC is [here](maclane).

[Categories for the Idle Mathematician](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8yHsr3EFj51F9XZ_Ka4bLnQoxTdMx0AL) by Richard Borcherds presupposes a background in math, but I caught some glimpses of the road ahead from his lessons.

[Category Theory for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US4Zr1WKD-8&list=PLCTMeyjMKRkoS699U0OJ3ymr3r01sI08l) by Richard Southwell
