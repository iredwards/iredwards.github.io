I'm learning Category Theory on a lark. I got interested after reading that Category Theory emphasizes looking at the relationships between objects over looking at objects themselves. I've said that was the most valuable lesson I got from doing a Math degree long ago. I got a copy of Eugenia Cheng's [The Joy of Abstraction](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/the-joy-of-abstraction/00D9AFD3046A406CB85D1AFF5450E657) and have enjoyed making my way through it. I'm also enjoying re-reading it along with the [book club](https://topos.site/joa-bookclub/) that started in February. These are some notes on my journey.

I've long been fascinated by *Tables of Contents* and *Indexes*. They are useful study aids. [Here](joa-index) are some additions I scribbled into the index of the Joyful book. My intention is to post my notes mapping relationships between some other useful resources. Too few ToCs are epic.
