Infrastructure is the means to an end, and works best when it stays out of your way. We call this _invisible infrastructure_; it typifies the best of modern scalable infrastructure. It is built on open source software, is cloud native, and is delivered ready for production in the trunk release. The Samsung SDS Cloud Native Computing Team (CNCT) is committed to this vision. Our participation in the Kubernetes project and as a [Platinum Member](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/announcements/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-samsung-sds-as-platinum-member) of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation is driven by these commitments.

Orchestrated container execution is the key that enables successful cloud native computing. Kubernetes is the best supported and fastest growing orchestration system. CNCT was an early adopter and contributor to Kubernetes [since its launch](https://youtu.be/fBa79csw9-M). We are proud to continue to contribute to the success of the project, especially in our leadership of the [Scalability SIG](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scalability) and [Testing SIG](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-testing). CNCT participated as a [partner at the launch of Kubernetes](https://youtu.be/fBa79csw9-M), and is a regular [presenter at KubeCon](https://youtu.be/gGHY6qRllWo).

Automation tooling is required to deploy and operate Kubernetes clusters efficiently, as infrastructure options multiply. Using Kubernetes for deployment is the best strategy for keeping degrees of freedom open to use multiple infrastructure options, including public and on-premises. CNCT's contribution to Kubernetes is centered about the open source [K2](https://github.com/samsung-cnct/k2) project, which provides tools to make it easier to run, manage, and monitor Kubernetes on all of the environments you operate with.

Adoption of cloud native approaches will be one of the more challenging changes an organization makes. For many organizations, transitioning to cloud native computing will be the most important and risky shift they will make. Outside expertise and resources are often needed to enable a successful transformation. CNCT provides expertise to product, operations, and development teams, inside and outside of Samsung.
